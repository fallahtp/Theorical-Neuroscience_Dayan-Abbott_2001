Answer ----->> The Poisson Process with a constant rate, generates every sequence of N spikes
               with equal probability, but because we can generate very large number of spike 
               sequences, and number of spike sequences that all its spikes happened in the 
               first 1% of time interval is very small compair to the total number of possible
               spike trains, it has very low chance that we see such a sequence.
